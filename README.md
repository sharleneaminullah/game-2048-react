## Technologies

- `Vanilla Javascript` (ES6 Class) – for Algorithm, 
- `ReactJs` – Frontend Framework 
- `react-swipeable` – Mobile touch support
- `Sass` – Processor Scripting Language for CSS
- `VSCode` – IDE
- `Babel-plugin-module-resolver` – relative path
- `Jest`
- `React_testing_library`
- `React_test_renderer`
- `Testing_library/jest-dom`
- `@testing_library/user_event`
- JSBEN.CH – function performance test
- `NPM` – package manager
- `Create-react-app` – for project build setup

I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in building the optimal algorith for the game. In the next iteration I plan on fixing the `module-resolver` & `VSCode intellisense` issue. Add "highest score" display feature. 

## How to play

- On Web - Use arrow keys to move the slides to left, right, up and down to add the generated numbers.
- On Mobile - Use swipe left, right, up and down only on the board area
